# Specificity Software: Achieve your goals by being specific.
Hello! This project is currently still in the "being worked on" stage, but I really love the concept and really look forward to seeing the final product. Enjoy the read!

## Motivation:
We all make goals in our lives, it can be any kind of goal. How often do we stick to it though? Sometimes it's really hard, goals can be quite 'ambitious' and therefore we believe its impossible to achieve. But big goals can always be broken down into smaller, more achieveable goals. These smaller goals then build off of each other, and become so called 'prerequisites' and 'dependencies', familiar terms in many Graph Algorithms. Inspired by the Topological Sort Algortihm (which has many real life applications!) I got the idea for this project of a goal-based app!

- Input your main goal
- Add dependent goals
- For example, if you want to lose weight, what do you have to do? You have to eat healthier, go to the gym, etc. In order to be able to do those things, you have to save money for groceries, etc. 
- All of these things are connected, hence there is a "Generate Dependency Graph" button that will display all of your goals & activities in the correct order of which you should achieve them.
